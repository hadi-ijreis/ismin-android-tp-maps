# TP6: Google Maps

## üìù Goal

The goal is to discover Google Apis mechanism by displaying a few markers on a map.

First:
- Create a new Android project

- Login to https://console.cloud.google.com
- Create a new project
- Navigate to "API et services" and then "Identifiants"
- Create a new API Key
- Add some restriction for this key

Notes: If you don't want to create a Google account ask the teacher for a demo API Key

Then: 
- Add a layout to display the map fragment in `activity-main.xml`
- Instantiate a `SupportMapFragment` in `MainActivity` and display it
- Make `MainActivity` implements the `OnMapReadyCallback` interface
- Do not forget to call the `getMapAsync` method on the map fragment
- Add a marker on Gardanne
- Move the map to Gardanne

## üõ∞ Extra 

Use the Android Location API to get the last known location and display it with a custom marker on the map
